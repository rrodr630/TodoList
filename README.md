# TodoList
This project is a UI that represent an application that reminds the user of things he/she needs to get done.
This was my first deep dive into Javafx, so you will see various features of this library as well as advance features of java like 
databinding.

The project is itself pretty simple: you create an item by giving it a name, a description and a due date. The item will then be shown on 
the list in chronological order and will also change color as the deadline approaches.

The "complicated" (relative) part is how everything is put together. This was my first grasp of what event handlers are as well as what 
databinding is.
